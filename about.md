Britney Wilson of American Fork, Utah and I were married on November 19, 2011 in
the [Salt Lake City Temple][SLC Temple]. We currently live
in Provo where I am finishing up my undergraduate degree at BYU. Britney
finished up her degree in Family Life at BYU and currently works at DoTerra and
babysits for a family. Britney and I enjoy hiking, watching movies, eating good
food, spending time with family and traveling whenever occasion allows.

<h2 id='about-hobbies-reading'>reading</h2>
I thoroughly enjoy reading. I read whenever I can and can often be seen with a
book. I grew up with a mother who was nearly obsessed with books which meant we
had thousands of books in bookshelves littered throughout our house for us kids
to enjoy. My favorite genres are fantasy and science fiction. I also enjoy
classics like [The Count of Monte Cristo][Monte Cristo] and [A Tale of Two
Cities][Two Cities] but I will read just about any good book. Some of my
favorites include:

- [The Wheel of Time][TWoT] - Robert Jordan
- [Mistborn][Mistborn] - Brandon Sanderson (I love all of his stuff really)
- [The Stormlight Archive][SA] - Brandon Sanderson
- [The Belgariad][Belgariad] - David Eddings
- [Ender's Game][Ender] - Orson Scott Card
- [Sabriel][Sabriel] - Garth Nix
- [Bartimaeus][Bartimaeus] - Jonathan Stroud
- [Artemis Fowl][AF] - Eoin Colfer
- [The Last Lecture][Lecture] - Randy Pausch and Jeffrey Zaslow

<h2 id='about-hobbies-music'>music</h2>
I grew up surrounded by music. My siblings and I played at least two instruments
growing up. My parents required us all to play the piano and urged us to pick up
at least one more instrument. My extra instruments became the guitar, the
trumpet and I also participated in choir. I enjoy playing soft piano and
acoustic guitar music. I also enjoy listening to music throughout each day.
Lately it has been [Enya][Enya], [Coldplay's new album][Coldplay], [The Piano
Guys][Piano Guys], and occasionally some dubstep. Pandora through
[Pianobar][Pianobar] makes all of this very convenient.

<h2 id='about-hobbies-eating'>eating</h2>
As I mentioned earlier, I really like to eat. I am not at all a picky eater and
will try just about anything. Since marrying Britney, however, I have learned to
enjoy eating at nice places. We especially love the [Cheesecake
Factory][Cheesecake] and will sometimes make the one hour drive up to Salt Lake
City just to go there. We have also been known to go to Park City to eat at the
[Eating Establishment][EE]. We like to find good food wherever we go. Some local
places we like to go include:

- [Burgers Supreme][BS]
- [Smash Burger][SB]
- [Texas Roadhouse][TR]
- [Zupas][Zupas]
- [Tucanos][Tucanos]
- [La Jolla Groves][JG]

<h2 id='about-hobbies-sports'>sports</h2>
I grew up playing every sport I could possibly be enrolled in. These included,
Basketball, Football, Baseball, Soccer, Wrestling, Swimming, Gymnastics, and
Racquetball. Almost all of those phased out except Soccer, Basketball and
Racquetball. I played soccer for my high school team and played recreation
basketball throughout and after high school. I still look for opportunities to
play any of those sports. 

I am also a big BYU sports fan. I follow football and basketball primarily but
will cheer on anyone wearing the BYU uniform (provided they aren't complete
knuckleheads).

<h2 id='about-hobbies-games'>games</h2>
My brothers and I played a lot of video games together when we were young. We
were often satisfied simply to watch one of the brothers play. We had many of the
classic games on NES like [Duck Hunt][Duck Hunt], [Techmo Bowl][Techmo Bowl] and
[Mike Tyson Punch-Out][Punch-Out]. We have enjoyed a succession of consoles from
Sega to N64 to PS2 to XBox360. We also played PC games like [Myst][Myst],
[Starcraft][Starcraft], and [Warcraft][Warcraft] (though not World of Warcraft).
We still sometimes get together to play games but prefer ones we can all play
together. 

We also all enjoy board and card games. We try to get together regularly to play
some kind of game. Some of our favorites include:

- [Tichu][Tichu]
- [Rook][Rook] (also checkout [Blackbird][Blackbird])
- [Sequence][Sequence]
- [Forbidden Desert][Forbidden Desert]
- [Forbidden Island][Forbidden Island]
- [Pandemic][Pandemic]
- [Betrayal at House on the Hill][Betrayal]

<h2 id='about-hobbies-traveling'>traveling</h2>
We aren't big-time travelers but nevertheless enjoy traveling. We enjoy going to
California and visiting Disneyland, the beaches and other random places in the
Greater Los Angeles and San Diego areas. St. George is a convenient getaway for
us and like to visit [Tuacahn][Tuacahn], eat some of the good food down there
and visit Zion National Park. Utah has some breathtaking [national][National
Parks] and state parks which we like to visit. We sometimes visit family in
[Alta Wyoming][Alta] and we spend a week at [Bear Lake][Bear Lake] every year.
We look forward to many opportunities in the future to travel.

<h1 id='about-aspirations'>aspirations</h1>

<h2 id='about-aspirations-family'>family</h2>
My wife and I want kids. We are interested in raising a family and helping
children reach their full potential. We want to build a beautiful modern home
somewhere in Utah Valley and live there until retirement if not longer.

<h2 id='about-aspirations-occupation'>occupation</h2>
While my goals in life never were to get into writing code, I have learned that
I absolutely love to create things on the computer. It is magic to me and the
best part is that I understand it (most of the time). I want to continue to
write code the rest of my life. Whether it be small utilities, app for a smart
phone or websites, I want to continue to hone my abilities to create. 

In terms of an occupation, I don't know if I necessarily want to work as a rank
and file developer for the duration of my career. I would like to get into
management somewhere that has an influence on the future of a product I am or
become passionate about. I am interested in start-ups because the developers
there are more influential in the grand scheme of the product. I am getting
business minor and am interested in an MBA because I want to be more involved
than someone who is simply told what to code.

<h2 id='about-aspirations-education'>education</h2>
As previously mentioned, I am interested in getting an MBA degree. I have also
toyed with the idea of getting a PH.D. in Computer Science. When I began my
undergraduate education the first thing I wanted to do was to become a
physician. Even though I no longer have those wishes I haven't quite given up
the idea of being called a doctor and obtaining a PH.D. is one way I could do
that.  In all seriousness though I believe I would enjoy the learning and
research involved in a Computer Science PH.D. program.

I also want to continue learning regardless of how formal it might be. I love
general education and want to continue to learn new things every day. 

<h1 id='about-community'>community</h1>
I served an two-year [LDS mission][Mission] in Atlanta Georgia ([Georgia Atlanta
North Mission][GANM]). I lived in Grayson, Lawrenceville, Sandy Plains, Athens
and Washington during my two years there and had many opportunities to provide
community service and to share my beliefs regarding [The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints](https://lds.org). I continue to practice my faith and am
always interested in ways I can help my community to be a stronger and more
conducive place for families to raise children.
